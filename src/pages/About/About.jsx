              <p>
              I'm Nij Padariya, currently diving into the world of M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur. I'm a first-year student hailing from Gujarat, and my heart lies in development. Beyond the coding challenges, you'll find me on the sports field, soaking in the joy of a good game. I'm passionate about becoming a great software developer, and every day at IIT Kanpur is a step toward that goal. Exciting times ahead as I navigate through the academic maze and pursue my dreams in the tech world!
